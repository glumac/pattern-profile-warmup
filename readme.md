# Warm Up

Your mission is to customize and beautify this profile page by doing the following:

CONTENT CHANGES IN INDEX.HTML

- Changing the content of the h1 to match your name
- Changing the content of the p to a description or motto of your own choosing
- Changing the LinkedIn, Twitter, Github (or Codepen) links to point to your own page- (If you don't have a twitter delete that link). Hint: You will have to change the href attribute value to change where the link points. If you have other links you can add those.

STYLE / APPEARANCE CHANGES IN STYLE.CSS

Changing the colors scheme of the page to something you personally like. Go to [Coolers](https://coolors.co/browser/best/1) and pick out a color scheme that you like.

We can select an element with its `class` attribute using a `.` before the class name.

so we would select the HTML element

`<a class="profile-link">`

in our CSS with

`.profile-link { * styles here * }`

Change the following elements' colors:

- body: BACKGROUND COLOR
- .profile-link: COLOR
- .profile-link:hover COLOR
- .profile-link:visited COLOR
- .square-one .inner COLOR
- .square-two .inner COLOR
- .square-three .inner COLOR

Bonus 1: Find a different font on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and change the appearance of text on this page following the "Embed" instructions:

![alt text](embed-font.png "Embedding A ")

Bonus 2: Further adjust the styling and content of the page as your heart desires. Maybe adjust the color of individual profile links using their unique classes (_.profile-link--1_ etc)

Bonus 3: Ajust the timing or dimensions of animation.
